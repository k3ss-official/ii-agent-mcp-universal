# II-Agent MCP Universal Connector

This repository contains the prototype for the Universal Dynamic Connector for II-Agent, which builds upon the MVP to create a fully dynamic tool using Crawl4AI for config discovery and local model support.

## Long-Term Vision

The Universal Dynamic Connector aims to:

1. Auto-discover API configs and rate limits using Crawl4AI
2. Install and configure any local model (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA via Hugging Face)
3. Dynamically adjust routing based on user-selected APIs and local models
4. Add persistent memory ("Borg Memory") across providers and II-Agent tasks
5. Include a WebUI for user configuration and monitoring
6. Enable scalability (e.g., load balancing, Hetzner instance support)
7. Package as a pip-installable module with extensible plugin architecture

## Project Status

This repository is currently in the planning and prototype phase. The MVP implementation is available at [ii-agent-mcp-mvp](https://github.com/k3ss-official/ii-agent-mcp-mvp).

## Planned Features

### Crawl4AI Integration
- Scrape API documentation to auto-detect endpoints, rate limits, and models
- Generate provider configurations dynamically
- Update configurations as APIs evolve

### Local Model Support
- Install and configure local models via Hugging Face
- Optimize for different hardware configurations
- Support for quantization and efficient inference

### Dynamic Routing
- Smart load balancing between cloud APIs and local models
- Cost optimization strategies
- Fallback based on availability, performance, and cost

### Persistent Memory
- Cross-provider memory persistence
- Task context preservation across II-Agent sessions
- Memory optimization and pruning strategies

### WebUI
- Configuration dashboard
- Performance monitoring
- Cost tracking and optimization suggestions

## Development Timeline

1. Phase 1: MVP (Complete) - Basic multi-provider support with fallback
2. Phase 2: Crawl4AI Integration - Auto-discovery of API configurations
3. Phase 3: Local Model Support - Integration with Hugging Face models
4. Phase 4: Persistent Memory - Implementation of "Borg Memory"
5. Phase 5: WebUI and Monitoring - User interface for configuration and monitoring
6. Phase 6: Scalability - Support for distributed deployment and load balancing
